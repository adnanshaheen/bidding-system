Compilation:
------------
There are two commands available to compile the code.
1- Debug mode
   Use the "make.debug" script to compile the code using debug mode.
   Command "# ./make.debug"
2- Release mode
   Use the "make.rel" script to compile the code using release mode.
   Command "# ./make.rel"

User can use the commands listed in the script files to compile with more options as well,
such as
    --enable-warnings
    Enable the warnings during compilation process, see the "configure.ac" for list of warning flags
    --enable-ipv6 (not implmented yet)
    Enabling this option will allow the code to compile for ipv6 mode (yet to implement, currently working only on ipv4)
The compilation script will look for required header files to confirm code compilation
Required files to run the compilation script properly
    NEWS, ChangeLog, AUTHORS, README, Makefile.am, src/*, include/*
project options
    Once the code is compiled and a binary "src/project0" is created
    we can provide the following input parameters to binary

    Usage: project0 [options]

    Bidding process

    -b, --bidders NUMBER    Set number of bidders
    -p, --port NUMBER       Set port number for manager

    if these parameters are not provided, in case of bidders, nunber bidders will be prompted from user at manager start.
    In case of port number is not specified, default port number '5000' is used.

Once the application is start, it should display the PID of Manager, PID of created bidders. The bids from bidders, and display the winner.
